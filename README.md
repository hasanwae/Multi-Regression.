Student Performance Prediction
This project aims to predict student performance based on various factors such as hours studied, previous scores, extracurricular activities, sleep hours, and sample question papers practiced. The dataset used is sp.csv, and the analysis is performed in a Jupyter Notebook (student_performance_(2).ipynb).
Project Overview
The Jupyter Notebook implements a linear regression model to predict the Performance Index of students using the following features:

Hours Studied: Number of hours the student studied.
Previous Scores: Scores from previous exams.
Extracurricular Activities: Binary indicator (0 or 1) for participation in extracurricular activities.
Sleep Hours: Number of hours the student sleeps.
Sample Question Papers Practiced: Number of practice papers completed.

The notebook includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
Dataset
The dataset (sp.csv) contains 10,000 records with the following columns:

Hours Studied: Integer (1–9)
Previous Scores: Integer (40–99)
Extracurricular Activities: Binary (0 or 1)
Sleep Hours: Integer (4–9)
Sample Question Papers Practiced: Integer (0–9)
Performance Index: Integer (10–100), the target variable

Dependencies
To run the notebook, you need the following Python libraries:

pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn

You can install them using:
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

How to Run

Clone this repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-performance-prediction.git


Ensure the dataset sp.csv is placed in the project directory or update the file path in the notebook.
Open the Jupyter Notebook:jupyter notebook student_performance_(2).ipynb


Run the cells in the notebook to perform the analysis and model training.

Notebook Structure

Imports: Import necessary libraries (pandas, matplotlib, sklearn).
Data Loading: Load the sp.csv dataset using pandas.
Data Exploration: Display the first and last few rows of the dataset using head() and tail().
Preprocessing: (To be completed) Standardize features using StandardScaler and split data into training and testing sets.
Model Training: (To be completed) Train a LinearRegression model on the training data.
Evaluation: (To be completed) Evaluate the model using metrics like Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and R² Score.

Next Steps

Complete the preprocessing steps (e.g., feature scaling, train-test split).
Train the linear regression model and evaluate its performance.
Visualize the results using matplotlib (e.g., scatter plots of predictions vs. actual values).
Add feature importance analysis or additional models for comparison.
